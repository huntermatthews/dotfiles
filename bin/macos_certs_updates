# NHGRI ITB is keeping the HHS (and related) certs updated in the keychain.

# 
# We need those certs in a .pem file format for add-on / programming languages to use.
# Point (environment variable) or symlink your tools cacerts.pem location to here.
#
# NOTE: This is a system location so you will need sudo to run this script.

security find-certificate -a -p /Library/Keychains/System.keychain >> /etc/ssl/cacerts.pem

# This is a system location, but if you needed your individual users keychain added to this 
# security find-certificate -a -p ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db > /etc/ssl/cacerts.pem

# Make certain all users can access this updated cacert bundle.
